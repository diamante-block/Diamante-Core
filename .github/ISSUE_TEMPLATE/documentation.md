## Before Creating an Issue

### Hey, I have a question!

Fantastic! However, the DiamNet-core issues repository is meant for reporting bugs and feature
requests related to DiamNet-core's implementation — if you have a question, we would recommend that
you:

* Take a look at DiamNet's [developer portal][1], where you'll find comprehensive documentation
  related to DiamNet.
* If you can't find an answer to your question, please submit a question to [DiamNet's Stack
  Exchange][2].
* If your question is non-developer centric, take a look at [DiamNet's Community][3].

In general, we close any issues that are questions best served elsewhere — we have a small
community of people that manages issues, and we want to ensure that the issues that remain open are
high quality (so we actually get around to implementing them!)

### I'd like to report a bug or feature request related to the documentation!

First, consider that DiamNet's documentation is spread across multiple repositories, and this repository only pertains to docs related to `DiamNet-core`, i.e. if it's in the `docs` folder. Please check to see if the source of the document you're looking at resides in this repository *before filing an issue*. If you're not sure where the source for a piece of documentation on our website exists, or you're looking to make a general feature request, please file an issue in the [DiamNet docs repository][4].
