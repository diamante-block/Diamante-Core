## Before Creating an Issue

### Hey, I have a question!

Fantastic! However, the DiamNet-core issues repository is meant for reporting bugs and feature
requests related to DiamNet-core's implementation — if you have a question, we would recommend that
you:

* Take a look at DiamNet's [developer portal][1], where you'll find comprehensive documentation
  related to DiamNet.
* If you can't find an answer to your question, please submit a question to [DiamNet's Stack
  Exchange][2].
* If your question is non-developer centric, take a look at [DiamNet's Community][3].

In general, we close any issues that are questions best served elsewhere — we have a small
community of people that manages issues, and we want to ensure that the issues that remain open are
high quality (so we actually get around to implementing them!)

### I'd like to request new functionality in DiamNet-core!

First, you have to ask whether what you're trying to file is an issue related to DiamNet's Protocol
OR if it's related to `DiamNet-core`, the C++ implementation that's in this repository.

Typically a request that changes how the core protocol works (such as adding a new operation,
changing the way transactions work, etc) is best filed in the [DiamNet Protocol repository][4].

However, if your change is related to the implementation (say you'd like to see a new command line
flag or HTTP command added to DiamNet-core), this is the place.

* Please check existing and closed issues in Github! You may have to remove the `is:open` filter.
* Check the releases page to see if your request has already been added in a later release.
